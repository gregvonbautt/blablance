[# Blablance

**Blablance** is an Android app that helps users track and reflect on the balance between activities
they personally define as positive or negative. The app is designed to be flexible, non-judgmental,
and entirely user-driven. It does not promote any particular philosophy or lifestyle - it simply
provides a space for users to observe their own behavior patterns over time.

## Overview

Everyone has habits they'd like to encourage, and others they'd prefer to limit. But those
categories can vary from person to person. Blablance allows users to define what "good" and "bad"
mean to them, and offers a simple interface to log those activities day by day. The goal is not
perfection or productivity - it’s awareness and balance, on the user’s own terms.
